# Azure Template
There is a template that was generated by Azure for our main resource group, hospital-at-home,
to create all of our azure resources exactly as we have them in with one file. We 
have not researched how they work, but if you can find a way to use this, you should
be able to create all the Azure resources instantly without configuring them one-by-one.
This is just a thought though and could be wrong and likely does not have all the things like
sample data for the database.

Unfortunately, since this file had keys in it, github would not let us upload it. As a result,
if your team would like to try using it to create all the Azure resources, reach out to
Yuxuan Jiang to request the file.
